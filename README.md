# Mechatronics GPA Calculator and Student Record Tracker

## Overview
This project involves developing a GPA calculator and student record tracker for the Mechatronics program at Kafrelsheikh University. The system is designed to calculate GPA based on the university's grading system and track student records.

## Features
- Load student data from a CSV file.
- Perform GPA calculation based on the university's grading system.
- Track student records including course codes, GPAs, and hours.
- Export updated student records to a CSV file.

## Dependencies
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/EmanElRify/MechatronicsProgramKFS.git
2. Install the required dependencies:
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib


## Usage
1. Ensure you have the 'Mechatronics_Data.csv' file in the same directory as the notebook.
2. Open the notebook in your preferred environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook).
3. Execute each cell in the notebook sequentially to load the data and perform analyses.
4. Modify the code as needed for your specific dataset or analysis requirements.

## Files
- `Mechatronics_Data.csv`: The dataset used for analysis.
- `Mechatronics_GPA_Calculator.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the GPA calculation and student record tracking code.
